					<h1>Front-End Developer Digest</h1>
					<p>This is a page where developers can express their thoughts or ideas about various topics ranging from current web standards and best practices to anecdotes about landing a first gig.  Anyone even mildly interested in tech is encouraged to follow and comment!  Many developer blogs feature useful posts that include tips, tricks, and techniques for incorporating cool effects into websites using a bit of clever CSS and JavaScript in tandem.  One of my first goals will be to point users towards these resources and create an archive.

					<h1>Making components modular <br /><span class='date'>December 22, 2016<span></h1>
					<p>Hello faithful followers!  We all know that in development of all sorts, modularity is often favored.  The reasons for this are clear:  Once a project becomes very large, it becomes tedious to rehash the exact same format for certain components that have already been created.  It is preferred to have a method more sophisticated than copy-paste that allows us to effortlessly control all components that are in a similar category.  For that reason, in this edition we will focus on the various approaches developers take to making components (of web applications in particular) more modular.  Read on for a list of current techniques, and please feel free to comment or make any suggestions of any components that you think are missing.

					<h1>Adding Article Snippets <br /><span class='date'>August 15, 2016<span></h1>
					<p>One feature that I've noticed is worth adding in many blogs is the separation of article content.  Visually, the inclusion of snippets of larger pieces of work can be accomplished by separating the content into their own blocks.  A url to an index including the full article can be included at the bottom of each snippet to enhance the readability of the main page without compromising the accessibility of the details displayed.

					<h1>Adding Articles <br /><span class='date'>June 10, 2016</span></h1>
					<p>Eventually, I'll have an organized method of adding articles to this page without directly altering the structure of the html.  Until then, I'll be updating the html directly.  This begs the question:  How do bloggers (that code their own websites) typically organize the articles that they add?  These articles usually have their own IDs corresponding to a particular entry or page.  Consider this the next topic of my research!</p>

					<h3>Why all the hype?</h3>
					<p>This page is helping me develop my skills on the front and back end of web development.  Before it goes live, we'll make sure that the layout, form submission, and interface is exactly as we've envisioned it.  The three major hurdles to having an impressive live page are:
						<ul>
							<li>An appealing and user-friendly layout (with pictures!)</li>
							<li>Easy-to-use interface for submitting comments and content (some backend required)</li>
							<li>Several pages with content to fill them, content that a reader base will find useful.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>How you can help</h3>
					<p>As we are in our developing phases, feel free to take a look at the source code with the editor of your choice and make recommendations!  Most of the styling and layout for this page is not yet set in stone, so take the opportunity to leave your mark on this page.</p>
